Protected Natural Areas and Areas Voluntarily Destined to the Conservation of Mexico (.gpkg)


On July 4, 2019, the National Commission of Natural Protected Areas (CONANP) (Mexico) updated the geographic data of the 182 Natural Protected Areas (ANP) divided into 12 regions. And of the Voluntary Areas for Conservation (ADVC). Portions of the national territory owned by communities (certified by CONANP within the General Law of Ecological Balance and Environmental Protection) that recognize the responsibility for safeguarding, management, and administration (but not economic support) of the natural wealth of their environment.

However. The ANP files had 181 errors (intersections), and the ADVC 8 errors.

I corrected the geometric errors of both files, which you can freely download from here. I hope that these files contribute in some way to the analysis, knowledge and preservation of our environment.
